```python
def isValid(s):
    # Count the frequency of each character
    char_freq = {}
    for char in s:
        char_freq[char] = char_freq.get(char, 0) + 1
    
    # Count the frequency of frequencies
    freq_count = {}
    for freq in char_freq.values():
        freq_count[freq] = freq_count.get(freq, 0) + 1
    
    # If all frequencies are the same, it's valid
    if len(freq_count) == 1:
        return "YES"
    
    # If there are more than 2 different frequencies, it's invalid
    if len(freq_count) > 2:
        return "NO"
    
    # If there are exactly 2 different frequencies
    freq1, freq2 = freq_count.keys()
    count1, count2 = freq_count[freq1], freq_count[freq2]
    
    # Check if removing one character would make all frequencies the same
    if (freq1 == 1 and count1 == 1) or (freq2 == 1 and count2 == 1):
        return "YES"
    if (abs(freq1 - freq2) == 1) and ((freq1 > freq2 and count1 == 1) or (freq2 > freq1 and count2 == 1)):
        return "YES"
    
    return "NO"

```

Now, let's break down this problem and solution using the Feynman technique:

Problem: "Sherlock and the Valid String"
Imagine you're Sherlock Holmes, and you've received a mysterious string. A string is considered "valid" if all characters occur the same number of times. You can remove one character from the string to make it valid. Your task is to determine if the string is valid or can be made valid by removing at most one character.

Our approach using frequency counting (a variation of the Sliding Window technique):

1. First, we count how many times each character appears in the string. This is like having different boxes for each letter and putting a marble in the box every time we see that letter.

2. Then, we count how many times each frequency appears. This is like grouping our boxes based on how many marbles they have.

3. Now, we have three possible scenarios:

   a. All boxes have the same number of marbles (all frequencies are the same):
      ```
      a: *** (3)
      b: *** (3)
      c: *** (3)
      ```
      This is already valid, so we return "YES".

   b. We have more than two different groups of boxes (more than two different frequencies):
      ```
      a: *    (1)
      b: **   (2)
      c: ***  (3)
      d: **** (4)
      ```
      This can't be made valid by removing one character, so we return "NO".

   c. We have exactly two different groups of boxes (two different frequencies):
      ```
      a: ***  (3)
      b: ***  (3)
      c: ***  (3)
      d: **** (4)
      ```
      This is where it gets tricky. We can make this valid if:
      - One frequency is 1 and it only occurs once (we can remove that character)
      - The difference between the two frequencies is 1, and the higher frequency only occurs once (we can remove one occurrence of that character)

4. If none of these conditions are met, we return "NO".

This solution is efficient because we only need to go through the string once to count the frequencies, and then we do some simple checks on those frequencies. It's much faster than trying every possible way of removing one character from the string.

The beauty of this approach is that it transforms the problem from thinking about individual characters to thinking about groups of characters with the same frequency. This higher-level view makes it much easier to reason about the problem and find a solution.
