| Problems          | Concepts            | Functionality |
|-------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| CamelCase         | Counting, Comparing  | Comparing Each Set of Characters and When There is Camel Case Split as Separate Word and Return total no of Splits  Example saveChangesInTheEditor return 5|
| String Construction | Comparing, Counting |Take a String Count Unique Letters in it and return the Count from it  Ex: abad return 3 |
| Two Characters       | Comparision, Concatenation,Manipulation | remove characters until the string is made up of any two alternating characters. When you choose a character to remove, all instances of that character must be removed. Determine the longest string possible that contains just two alternating letters. Example beabeefeab if we remove e and f babab return count 5   |
|GemStones             | Comparision,Counting |arr['abc','abc','bc' ]The minerals b and c appear in each rock, so there are  2 gemstones.|
|Beautiful Binary String |SubStrings,Traversal,Manipulation| Alice has a binary string. She thinks a binary string is beautiful if and only if it doesn't contain the substring "010", Example  Input 0100101010 Output 3(No of Changes) Explanation: "Changes Values at b[2],b[5],b[9]" 
|Game of Thrones 1       | Anagram,Palindrome,Traversal|Given One String We Should Check anyway to make that as palindrome by swapping characters at indexes Example: cdcdcdcdeeeef Output: "Yes" Explain: ddcceefeeccdd |
